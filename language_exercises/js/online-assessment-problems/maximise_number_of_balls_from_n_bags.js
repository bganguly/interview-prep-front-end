given three bags with infinite number of balls  
write a function to maximise the number of balls possible to pick in k tries  
so maximiseBalls(number of tries, # of balls in bag A, # of balls in bag B, # of balls in bag C)  
maximiseBalls(2,1,2,2) should return 4  
maximiseBalls(3,1,2,2) should return 5
