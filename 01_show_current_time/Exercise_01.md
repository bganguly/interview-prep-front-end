Build a react app that shows the current date time (which changes every 3 seconds) centered in view port.  
date-time string format can be either ISO or any other format.  
the date-time line should render with any fixed-width font, so that there are no momentary jarring etc.
Mention some room for improvement (setInterval cleanup etc).
